RICG-responsive-images
---

Bringing automatic default responsive images to wordpress.

This plugin works by including all available image sizes for each image upload. Whenever wordpress outputs the image through the media uploader, or whenever a featured image is generated, those sizes will be included in the image tag via the [srcset](http://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/) attribute. 

##Hardcoding in template files

 You can output a responsive image anywhere you'd like by using the following syntax:

``<img src="pathToImage" <?php echo tevkori_get_src_sizes( TheIdOfYourImage, theLargestImageSizeNeeded ); ?> />``

ex.)

```<img src="myimg.png" <?php echo tevkori_get_src_sizes( 11, 'tevkoriMedium-img' ); ?> />```
